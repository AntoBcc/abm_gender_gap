# Gender Gap in the Labor Market: an Agent-Based Perspective

We propose a novel approach to analysing the gender gap in the labor market, through the use of agent-based modelling.
First, we show how factors emerging from the literature contribute to creating and perpetrating the gap in our model. Then, we simulate different policy interventions.
Solutions such as imposing gender quotas or hosting motivational events to foster mentorship do not yield satisfactory results when introduced to our model.
Our simulations point, instead, towards a combination of policies aimed at increasing confidence for young women joining the work-force and enabling them with further opportunities for on-the- job training, for instance through the guarantee of increased family support.

All code and simulations were developed from scratch in Python, using [Mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
